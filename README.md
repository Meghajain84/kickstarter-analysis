# kickstarter-analysis
Module 1 challenge


## Overview of Project

Overall purpose is to help playwright Louise raise money for her upcoming play 'Fever'. For that we are analysing the crowdfunding data to come up with successful strategy to launch her play.

'Fever' came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis:

1) Looking at the following graphs for outcomes based on parent category and subcategory, we can derive the information that 'Fever' is bound to be successful as its in the top parent category (theater, music, films/video) and subcatehgory (plays)

2) Based on launch date, summer months have yielded successful outcomes for all categories

### Challenges:
1) I have Excel(version 2010) installed on my personal laptop. This older version didn't have 'group' feature that was needed for deliverable 1; I had to work on my office laptop(having latest office 365) to access that feature for deliverable 1. I could have used function 'month' instead too on older version to get the same result
2) Following instructions to complete the above two deliverables was easy, but the challenging part was to understand the rationale behind the charts and tie them to big picture. The line charts made the analysis much easier to read.

## Results

### Two conclusions from Theater Outcomes by Launch Date (Image Name: Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png):

![Theater outcomes by Launch Date](https://github.com/Meghajain84/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

1) Theater have peaked successful outcome in May month, and overall summer months have been successful for theater when launch date was in summer
2) Canceled theater activities have remained overall constant except in October month

### Conclusion from the Outcomes based on Goals (Image Name: Outcomes_vs_Goals.png):

![Outcomes vs goals](https://github.com/Meghajain84/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

1) Percentage successful is inversely proportional to percentage failure outcome, they are mirror image to each other. The funding goal of 45000-49999 have been most successful.

### Limitations of the dataset
1) Only few countries data has been captured here
2) The sample set is not granular like what part of country, type(age, occupation) of people who contributed

### Other possible tables and/or graphs
1) We could create table/graph using average donation in relation to outcomes, that could be pushed more in advertising
2) We could create table/graph using date ended as well to know if that played any role in outcome
