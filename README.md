Module 1 challenge


##Overview of Project
Overall purpose is to help playwright Louise raise money for her upcoming play 'Fever'. For that we are analysing the crowdfunding data to come up with successful strategy to launch her play.
Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals

##Analysis and Challenges
###Analysis:

2)
###Challenges:
1) I have Excel(version 2010) installed on my personal laptop. This older version didn't have 'group' feature that was needed for deliverable 1; I had to work on my office laptop(having latest office 365) to access that feature for deliverable 1. I could have used function 'month' instead too on older version to get the same result
2) Following instructions to complete the above two deliverables was easy, but the challenging part was to understand the rationale behind the charts and tie them to big picture. The line charts made the analysis much easier to read.

##Results
###Two conclusions from Theater Outcomes by Launch date:
1) Theater have peaked successful outcome in May month, and overall summer months have been successful for theater when launch date was in summer
2) Canceled theater activities have remained overall constant except in October month
###Conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals:
1) Percentage successful is inversely proportional to percentage failure outcome, they are mirror image to each other. The funding goal of 45000-49999 have been most successful.
###Limitations of the dataset
1) Only few countries data has been captured here
2) The sample set is not granular like what part of country, type(age, occupation) of people who contributed
###Other possible tables and/or graphs
1) We can create table/graph using average donation in relation to outcomes, that could be pushed more in advertising
2) We can create table/graph using date ended as well, if that played any role in outcome
